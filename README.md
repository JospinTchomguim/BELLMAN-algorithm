# BELLMAN-algorithm

Bellman's algorithm is an algorithm that calculates shortest paths from a
given source vertex in a weighted directed graph. It authorizes the presence of certain
arcs of negative weight and makes it possible to detect the existence of an absorbing circuit, that is to say
of strictly negative total weight, accessible from the source vertex.
It is a greedy dynamic programming algorithm, it visits all solutions
possible.
